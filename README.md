# NA62Stylesheet
Root stylesheet for NA62 to match a similar style created in mplhep for python

## To Add
- [ ] Print and presentation versions? 
  - (not sure if sizing might change between the two)
- [ ] Default options for label text?
  - e.g if MC -> NA62 Simulation
  - NA62 Preliminary etc.
- [ ] Viewing in a TBrowser did not look good on my quick test
  - Only a problem if using the rootlogon to set NA62 style for all of root.
